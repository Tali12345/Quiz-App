## The Project

All the multiple choice questions in the quiz were generated by ChatGPT.

The user should choose for each questions a answer, by clicking the corresponding answer button. After that, by clicking the submit button, the user gets the results - how many questions he answered correctly. Moreover, his answers are marked in green if his answer is correct, and in red otherwise.
After the submission, the user has the option to retake the quiz.

The redux store holds the current application state. The local storage persists the application state so after clicking the refresh button in the browser the state is still kept.
